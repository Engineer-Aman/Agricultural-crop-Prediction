# Agricultural-crop-Prediction

:wave: Hi in this data science project I am going to predict the 'Crop' based on soil proerties and climate.

In below video you can check the workflow and overview of this project.:point_down:

A few weeks ago, I saw farmers working hardly and devoutly to grow crops for us. I was happy to see them work so hard.
But I found out that even after so much struggle our farmers grow crops to some extent. They failed to maximize crop growth. It made me think about why farmers are not able to increase their productivity.
Then I started thinking about the reasons why our agronomist could not reach maximum productivity.


Many factors affect the productivity of crops but two factors that affect crops productivity directly are,

### 1.Soil Conditions
### 2.Climate Conditions

Keeping these factors in my mind, I tried to build a Machine Learning model that will take different Climate and Soil conditions and predict a crop that can make maximum growth in these certain conditions and I did. By using this model, agronomists will be able to know which crop is more productive.
